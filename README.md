""Glassmorphism

"Glassmorphism" is a user interface design trend that uses the Flutter widget library. It is well-equipped for changes in UI patterns and styles, as well as various evolving styles. The UI Glassmorphism that has been influenced by many development teams has become one of the hottest UI patterns. Using the Glassmorphism card, we blur the background of the UI, simultaneously applying that filter to the virtual glass through a multi-layered methodology to make it appear as if the item is skimming through space. This pattern has become increasingly popular since it is an open-source UI development kit from Flutter that can be used for UI design for differentÂ platforms.
